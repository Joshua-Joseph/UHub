# uhub

A Flutter project.

## Getting Started

We built this app in order to bring all the free educational resources available in the internet under one roof.

The user can sign up and create an accout. He/She can view the free resources available for him/her according to the stream he/she has selected. Some other free resources are also provided which are very helpful for studies. 

The signin feature was implemented through SAWO labs.
We used Firebase Database to store data of the users.
